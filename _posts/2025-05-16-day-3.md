### What I Set Out to Do
Today I set out to just continue my progress with the primary fucntion. I wanted to finish the hit/stand part of my function which would
then put me in a very comfortable spot to finish on time. I also wanted to organize my notebook a bit more and add more comments, because
in the chaotic scramble to get work done you kind of neglect those things.

### What I Actually Did
While I did start out by working out the hit/stand part of my game, I quickly realized I had overlooked something that would need to be
relooked at, which was the way aces worked. I knew that they could by 1 or 11 but I thought it would be much easier to implement that into
code. However, I decided to make a new function called calculate_total that also took into account aces, up to two cards at a time, which
is the max you'll need. After I finished that I briefly worked on formatting/organization for my functions.

### What I Learned or Noticed

I'm learning that this is going to be a grueling project almost soley because of the aces. Even though it's very unlikely, I have to
account for the possibility that the player/dealer gets 3 or even 4 aces. I'm considering simply leaving coding for that possibility for
last because then I can get a functional code before the nitpicky stuff.

### What's Next

In the coming couple of days, I will prioritize the main function and write a code that accounts for most cases, because then if I have
time I can come back and account for the possibility of 3 or 4 aces in one hand.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Kabir, a student interested in card games, exploring new designs, and having fun along the way.  
This project was part of my final quest in Copmuter Programming, and it reflects what I’ve learned about game making in python.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *Blackjack*   
**One-line pitch:** Simulating a game of blackjack with none of the troubles of losing money but still the thrill of winning.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Kabir, a student interested in card games, exploring new designs, and having fun along the way.  
This project was part of my final quest in Copmuter Programming, and it reflects what I’ve learned about game making in python.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *Blackjack*   
**One-line pitch:** A user friendly game of blackjack with none of the troubles of losing and all of the thrill of winning.

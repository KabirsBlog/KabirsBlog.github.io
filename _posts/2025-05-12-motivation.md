### Project Focus

My project is called the Blackjack Table. It's an interactive game where you can play blackjack. What's challenging about this project is the many specific and difficult to implement rules that exist in blackjack like Ace being equal to 1 or 11.

### Why This Project 

I was interested in this project because blackjack and poker have always been interesting games to me, but blackjack is more achievable in the time frame we have. This is the right project for me because it will challenge me just enough to the point where my coding knowledge will be challenged and consequently solidify lots of the techniques we used this year in my head.

### What I Want to Learn

I wan to strenghten my ability to modularize/break up a task into sepearate functions, and learn how to incorporate it all into one big funciotion. Beyond coding, I want to develop the persistence that it takes to be an effective debugger. I expect that I will encounter a lot of problems with my code, so me having to push through will be vital experience.


### My Approach 

I plan to divide my text two weeks into sections. First thing to do is to break up the function/task into different parts and decide what those parts are. Then I can decide whats the most important and start those first. Things like making everything look pretty and actually realistic will probably be priortize later. For me , done enough means that I have functioning code with only the occasional error in very specific edge cases. I will decide to stop polishing when I feel like I've given enough time into my project that I'm happy I gave it my best and my progress also reflects that.

### What's Next

In the next stage of my project, I will break the task down into mini functions. Then I will decide which functions are essential and do them first. After that I will start the bulk of my programming and set dedicated times after school to doing my work.
